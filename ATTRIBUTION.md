# Attribution file for external APIs and libraries
File that includes all the non-Google APIs and libraries we used

## [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
We used the OpenWeatherMap API as a weather data source and the input we got from it can be visible in the [event page](src/main/webapp/event.html).

## [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)
We used the FullCalendar library to provide a calendar interface to our users in the [calendar page](src/main/webapp/calendar.html).
